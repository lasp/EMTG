On a local Windows machine, \ac{EMTG} is most often executed via the PyEMTG \ac{GUI}. However, it may also be executed from the command line, from a script, or using the Windows Explorer. In the first two instances, \ac{EMTG} is executed by invoking the EMTGv9.exe command with the name of an \ac{EMTG} options file (``*.emtgopt'') as the only command-line argument. To execute via Windows Explorer, open two Windows Explorer windows. In one, navigate to Path/To/EMTG/Repo/bin. In the other, navigate to the location of the \ac{EMTG} options file to be executed. Drag and drop the \ac{EMTG} options file onto EMTGv9.exe to execute.
