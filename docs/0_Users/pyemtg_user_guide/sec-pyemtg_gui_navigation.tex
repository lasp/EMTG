\noindent Once in the PyEMTG \ac{GUI} a user is presented with a screen where they can use the File menu to either open an existing mission via an \ac{EMTG} options file or create a new mission. All PyEMTG GUI functionality can be accessed through a user's keyboard and mouse or soley using the keyboard. The ability to solely use a keyboard to interact with the PyEMTG GUI should also allow it to be compatible with assitive technology devices. The selections of the File menu contains keyboard shortcuts that a user can use for quick access to the File menu selections.
