	abstract="This report continues the practice where the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements revises recommendations regarding those topics for the planets, satellites, minor planets, and comets approximately every 3 years. The Working Group has now become a ``functional working group'' of the IAU, and its membership is open to anyone interested in participating. We describe the procedure for submitting questions about the recommendations given here or the application of these recommendations for creating a new or updated coordinate system for a given body. Regarding body orientation, the following bodies have been updated: Mercury, based on MESSENGER results; Mars, along with a refined longitude definition; Phobos; Deimos; (1) Ceres; (52) Europa; (243) Ida; (2867) {\v{S}}teins; Neptune; (134340) Pluto and its satellite Charon; comets 9P/Tempel 1, 19P/Borrelly, 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, and 103P/Hartley 2, noting that such information is valid only between specific epochs. The special challenges related to mapping 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko are also discussed. Approximate expressions for the Earth have been removed in order to avoid confusion, and the low precision series expression for the Moon's orientation has been removed. The previously online only recommended orientation model for (4) Vesta is repeated with an explanation of how it was updated. Regarding body shape, text has been included to explain the expected uses of such information, and the relevance of the cited uncertainty information. The size of the Sun has been updated, and notation added that the size and the ellipsoidal axes for the Earth and Jupiter have been recommended by an IAU Resolution. The distinction of a reference radius for a body (here, the Moon and Titan) is made between cartographic uses, and for orthoprojection and geophysical uses. The recommended radius for Mercury has been updated based on MESSENGER results. The recommended radius for Titan is returned to its previous value. Size information has been updated for 13 other Saturnian satellites and added for Aegaeon. The sizes of Pluto and Charon have been updated. Size information has been updated for (1) Ceres and given for (16) Psyche and (52) Europa. The size of (25143) Itokawa has been corrected. In addition, the discussion of terminology for the poles (hemispheres) of small bodies has been modified and a discussion on cardinal directions added. Although they continue to be used for planets and their satellites, it is assumed that the planetographic and planetocentric coordinate system definitions do not apply to small bodies. However, planetocentric and planetodetic latitudes and longitudes may be used on such bodies, following the right-hand rule. We repeat our previous recommendations that planning and efforts be made to make controlled cartographic products; newly recommend that common formulations should be used for orientation and size; continue to recommend that a community consensus be developed for the orientation models of Jupiter and Saturn; newly recommend that historical summaries of the coordinate systems for given bodies should be developed, and point out that for planets and satellites planetographic systems have generally been historically preferred over planetocentric systems, and that in cases when planetographic coordinates have been widely used in the past, there is no obvious advantage to switching to the use of planetocentric coordinates. The Working Group also requests community input on the question submitting process, posting of updates to the Working Group website, and on whether recommendations should be made regarding exoplanet coordinate systems.",

is to explore backward in time via its observations of the primitive bodies, Vesta and Ceres. Thus Dawn embarks on three journeys. The first is its tumultuous
temporal terrestrial trek during development. The second is its soon-to-be voyage in space to 4 Vesta, the second most massive asteroid in the main belt, and to
1 Ceres, the most massive. The third is its journey backward in time to infer the conditions as the solar system was formed. Finally, we discuss how it is
possible to go back even further in time, beyond the horizon of the Dawn mission to obtain "pre Dawn" observations at 10 Hygiea, the fourth most massive
asteroid, and one more primitive than Vesta and Ceres. &copy; 2007 COSPAR.},

abstract = {The method of collocation and nonlinear programming has been used recently to solve a number of optimal control problems.  In this method
polynomials are commonly used to represent the state variable time histories over subintervals of the total time of interest. These polynomials correspond to a
family of modified-Gaussian quadrature rules known as the Gauss-Lobatto rules.  Presently, relatively low-order rules from the Gauss-Lobatto family, such as the
trapezoid and Simpson's rule, are used to construct collocation solution schemes.  In this work higher-order Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rules are formulated using
collocation point selection based on a particular family of Jacobi polynomials.  The advantage of using a quadrature rule of higher order is that the
approximation using the higher degree polynomial may be more accurate, due to finite precision arithmetic, than a formulation based on a lower degree
polynomial.  In addition, the number of subinterval and, therefore, the number of nonlinear programming parameters needed to solve a problem accurately may be
significantly reduced from that required if the conventional trapezoidal or Simpson's quadrature schemes are used.  An optimal trajectory maximizing final
energy for a low-thrust spacecraft is used to demonstrate the benefits of using the higher-order schemes.},

the Earth-departure phase and the effects of the Earth's gravity during the lunar-arrival phase. Total transfer time is minimized. However, because the
propulsion system operates continuously, i.e., no coast arc is allowed, the trajectory is also propellant minimizing. A very low initial thrust acceleration of
10<sup>-4</sup>g yields flight times of approximately 32 days requiring many revolutions of both the Earth and the moon. Ignoring third-body gravity, i.e.,
solving the problem as two coupled two-body problems, changes the optimal trajectory only slightly, for example, decreasing the travel time by a few hours. The
optimal trajectory is also insensitive to change in engine specific impulse so long as the same initial thrust acceleration magnitude is used.},

incorporated as a set of nonlinear constraints on the problem variables.  No a priori assumptions on the optimal control time history are required.  An
Earth-to-Mars transfer with a very low thrust acceleration of 0.0001 g is used as an example.},

   Venus-Earth-Earth-Jupiter and Venus-Earth-Mars-Earth. Estimates are made
   for the shortest flight times for a given launch energy to each planet.
   This graphical technique should provide mission designers with a potent
   tool for finding economical gravity-assist trajectories to many targets

   trajectories, exploiting a combination of gravity assist maneuvers and
   low-thrust propulsion. A multiphase parametric approach has been used to
   introduce swing-bys, treated as coast phases between two thrusted or
   coasting trajectory arcs. Gravity maneuvers are at first modeled with a
   linked-conic approximation and then introduced through a full
   three-dimensional propagation including perturbations by the Sun. The
   method is successfully applied to the design of a mission to planet
   Mercury, for which different options corresponding to different
   sequences of gravity maneuvers or launch opportunities are presented.}},

abstract="In this paper, a new approach to planetary mission design is described which automates the search for gravity-assist trajectories. This method finds all conic solutions given a range of launch dates, a range of launch energies and a set of target planets. The new design tool is applied to the problems of finding multiple encounter trajectories to the outer planets and Venus gravity-assist trajectories to Mars. The last four-planet grand tour opportunity (until the year 2153) is identified. It requires an Earth launch in 1996 and encounters Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Venus gravity-assist trajectories to Mars for the 30 year period 1995--2024 are examined. It is shown that in many cases these trajectories require less launch energy to reach Mars than direct ballistic trajectories.",

title="Global Optimization on Funneling Landscapes",
journal="Journal of Global Optimization",
year="2000",
volume="18",
number="4",
pages="367--383",
abstract="Molecular conformation problems arising in computational chemistry require the global minimization of a non-convex potential energy function representing the interactions of, for example, the component atoms in a molecular system. Typically the number of local minima on the potential energy surface grows exponentially with system size, and often becomes enormous even for relatively modestly sized systems. Thus the simple multistart strategy of randomly sampling local minima becomes impractical. However, for many molecular conformation potential energy surfaces the local minima can be organized by a simple adjacency relation into a single or at most a small number of funnels. A distinguished local minimum lies at the bottom of each funnel and a monotonically descending sequence of adjacent local minima connects every local minimum in the funnel with the funnel bottom. Thus the global minimum can be found among the comparatively small number of funnel bottoms, and a multistart strategy based on sampling funnel bottoms becomes viable. In this paper we present such an algorithm of the basin-hopping type and apply it to the Lennard--Jones cluster problem, an intensely studied molecular conformation problem which has become a benchmark for global optimization algorithms. Results of numerical experiments are presented which confirm both the multifunneling character of the Lennard--Jones potential surface as well as the efficiency of the algorithm. The algorithm has found all of the current putative global minima in the literature up to 110 atoms, as well as discovered a new global minimum for the 98-atom cluster of a novel geometrical class.",

@article{OptimizationForScientificMerit,
	title = "Trajectory Optimization for Missions to Small Bodies with a Focus on Scientific Merit",
	abstract = "Trajectory design for missions to small bodies is tightly coupled both with the selection of targets for the mission and with the choice of spacecraft power, propulsion, and other hardware. Traditional methods of trajectory optimization have focused on finding the optimal trajectory for an a priori selection of destinations and spacecraft parameters. Recent research has expanded the field to multidisciplinary systems optimization that includes spacecraft parameters. The logical next step is to extend the optimization process to include target selection based not only on engineering figures of merit but also scientific value. This article presents a new technique to solve the multidisciplinary mission optimization problem for small-body missions, including classical trajectory design, the choice of spacecraft power and propulsion systems, and the scientific value of the targets. This technique, when combined with modern parallel computers, enables a holistic view of the small-body mission design process that previously required iteration among several different design processes.",
