\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the previous tutorials, you’ve created several flybys of other planets on the way to the destination body. All these flybys used a \ac{ZSOI} patched conics approximation, Figure \ref{fig:patched_conic_transcription}. In this model, the gravity-assist effect of the flyby is modeled as an instantaneous change in the velocity vector defined by analytical approximations. As a result, this model is extremely computationally efficient, but lacks high accuracy.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Flybys_patched_conic_transcription.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:patched_conic_transcription}Patched Conic Transcription.}
\end{figure}

\noindent In this tutorial, you will walk through how to make \ac{EMTG} model the flyby more accurately, with the spacecraft flying around the body instead of through it, while more realistically including the effects of the flyby body’s gravity during the close approach as in Figure \ref{fig:non_zsoi_transcription}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Flybys_ephem_referenced_gravity_assist_multiple_shooting_transcription.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:non_zsoi_transcription}Ephemeris-referenced Gravity-assist Multiple-shooting Transcription.}
\end{figure}

\noindent \ac{EMTG} comes with several Python scripts to help transform a \ac{ZSOI} flyby into a fully propagated flyby. First, if necessary, you can convert a multi-Phase Journey (a Journey that contains one or more bodies in the “Flyby Sequence” section of the “Journey Options” tab) to a series of single-Phase journeys (each flyby or body departure/arrival occurs at a Journey boundary) with one Python script. Then, you can convert the single-Phase-Journeys Mission to a Mission with propagated flybys using another Python script. When you finish this process, each departure, flyby, and arrival body will be represented by multiple Journeys switching the primary gravitational body (the central body) at each \ac{SOI} crossing. Table \ref{tab:emtg_conversion_scripts} summarizes this process.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Make a new directory for this tutorial called \texttt{Flybys} and copy and paste in the \texttt{EVM.emtgopt} file, and \texttt{hardware\_models} folders from the Journey Boundaries tutorial. Open the \texttt{EVM.emtgopt} file and change the 
paths for “Hardware library path” in the ``Spacecraft Options'' tab, and ``Working directory'' in the ``Output Options'' tab to a new \texttt{results} directory the new \texttt{Flybys} directory. Don’t forget the trailing slash in ``Hardware library path''.

\noindent You will also want to have the solution to this low-fidelity mission as an initial guess for the higher fidelity conversions, so either run mission again without changing any additional options or have the solution folder from the first EVM run in the Journey Boundaries tutorial handy. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Universe Files}
\label{sec:universe_files}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You need to make new Universe files before you can run the converted missions. You already have a Universe file for the Sun and for Mars, but you need them for Earth and Venus, as well, because those two bodies will now be the central bodies of Journeys. In the \texttt{EVM\_universe} directory, make two copies of the \texttt{Sun.emtg\_universe} file and call them \texttt{Earth.emtg\_universe} and \texttt{Venus.emtg\_universe}, respectively. Copy the ``\#menu of bodies'' line for the Sun from \texttt{Mars.emtg\_universe} and paste it into the Earth and Venus Universe files. Delete the ``\#menu of bodies'' line for Earth from the Earth file and the Venus line from the Venus file. Like when making the Mars universe file in the Journey Boundaries tutorial, make sure that the ID number for each body in the menu of bodies is unique. (E.g., Sun and Mercury cannot both have ID 1.) Finally, update the central body section of the Earth and Venus Universe files. 

\noindent Reference the text below for Venus.

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\noindent When finished, you should have a working directory that looks like the one in Figure \ref{fig:working_dir_ex}. (Your results directory will be empty until later in the tutorial.) Refer to the Universe files provided with this tutorial if you are unsure about the Universe files or directory setup. You now have everything you need to convert the \texttt{EVM.emtgopt} file to higher fidelity missions.

\section{Conversion to Single-Phase Journeys}
\label{sec:conversion_to_single_phase_journeys}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The first step towards a high-fidelity \ac{EMTG} mission is removing Venus from the flyby sequence and inserting it as a new Journey departure and arrival point. This is easy to do with PyEMTG, but you’re going to take advantage of a Python converter script to show how it can be done automatically. One advantage of using the Python converter script is that it automatically populates the initial guess for the new Journey structure with the values from the old Journey structure, including appropriately renaming the relevant decision variables. As a result, if the Journey structure is the only thing that is changed, \ac{EMTG} should produce exactly the same trajectory with either Journey structure.

\noindent The script is located in your \ac{EMTG} repository at \texttt{EMTG/PyEMTG/Converters/convert\_to\_single\_ phase\_journeys.py}. Open this file with a text editor like Notepad++ or VSCode. Notice that there is a \texttt{sys.path.append} line near the top of the file in the imports section. This path needs to point to your PyEMTG directory. If you installed EMTG somewhere other than what is shown, update this line so that the script has the correct path to your PyEMTG directory. Save the file. Now, you will perform the first conversion to single-phase Journeys.

\noindent Open a terminal and execute the script with Python, providing two arguments: one for the path to the EMTG options file (\texttt{EVM.emtgopt}) and the other for the path to the EVM solution file (\texttt{EVM.emtg}). As an example (all in one line),
\texttt{python C:\textbackslash <EMTG-FOLDER>\textbackslash emtg\textbackslash PyEMTG\textbackslash Converters \textbackslash convert\_to\_single\_phase\_journeys.py C:\textbackslash <PATH-TO-WORKING-DIR>\textbackslash EVM.emtgopt C:\textbackslash <PATH-\newline TO-WORKING-DIR>\textbackslash results\textbackslash EVM\_DATE\_TIME\textbackslash EVM.emtg}

\noindent You should now have a file called \texttt{EVM\_singlePhase.emtgopt} alongside your \texttt{EVM.emtgopt} file. Open \texttt{EVM\_singlePhase.emtgopt} in PyEMTG. You should have two Journeys called ``Earth\_to\_Mar s\_phase0'' and ``Earth\_to\_Mars\_phase1'' with the Journey arrival and departures shown in Table \ref{tab:single_phase_journey_state_types}. The full list of settings is shown in Figure \ref{fig:single_phase_journey_options}. Phase 0 refers to the Earth-to-Venus trajectory, and phase 1 refers to the Venus-to-Mars trajectory. Note that this does not change the Mars arrival state to the free point Journey arrival state you saw in the Journey Boundaries tutorial.

	\caption{\label{fig:single_phase_journey_options}Single Phase Journey Options.}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Seeding}
\label{sec:seeding}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Open the \texttt{EVM\_singlePhase.emtgopt} in a text editor or select “File” -\textgreater “open file in editor” (Ctrl+e) in PyEMTG. Scroll down to the Journeys section and look for the entry ``\#trial decision vector'' at the end of each section of Journey options. The trial decision vector for each Journey has been ``seeded'' or filled in using the solution from \texttt{EVM.emtg} as an initial guess. The names of the decision variables may be difficult to parse at first due to the lack of spaces, but you will probably be able to understand at least vaguely what a lot of the variables mean.

\noindent \knownissuelabel{NOTE: PyEMTG may not open the file in a text editor if the file is associated with another program.}{text_editor_issue}

\noindent You can also seed the new \ac{EMTG} options file you just created with the results from another trial by using the ``Seed MBH?'' option in the ``Solver Options'' tab of the \acs{GUI}. Seeding provides a starting point for the optimizer and can help the optimizer find a solution more quickly than starting from a random guess. Switch to the ``Solver Options'' tab and check this box to reveal the ``Trial decision vector or initial guess'' button, which you can use to select previous results (i.e., a previous .emtg file) as an initial guess for this mission. These settings are shown in Figure \ref{fig:seed_mbh}.
 
\noindent \textit{NOTE:} The conversion script already provided a good initial guess and populated the appropriate sections of \texttt{EVM\_singlePhase.emtgopt}. The new single-Phase Mission decision vector is not the same as the original Mission, and the conversion script has provided initial guesses for each new variable. Using the ``Seed MBH?'' box here and selecting the old \texttt{EVM.emtg} as the seed will NOT provide a guess for every decision variable in the new single-Phase Mission, and you will get \ac{EMTG} console output such as:

\noindent \texttt{Initial guess missing value for: j0p0MGAnDSMsEphemerisPeggedIntercept: V\_infinity\_x}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Flybys_seed_mbh.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:seed_mbh}Seed \acs{MBH}.}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Run the Mission}
\label{sec:run_the_mission_single_phase}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Run the file (Ctrl+r) and note that the \ac{EMTG} terminal output reads something like,

\noindent \texttt{NLP incumbent point and exit point are feasible and incumbent point is superior to exit point.}

\noindent Or

\noindent \texttt{NLP incumbent point was infeasible but less infeasible than the exit point.}

\noindent after loading the \acs{SPICE} files. Depending on your mission and the solution provided to the conversion script, the output of the single-phase script may or may not already have a feasible initial guess. (If the \texttt{EVM.emtg} file you provided to the conversion script was feasible, the new Mission should be feasible, too. You can check this directly by switching to the ``Solver Options'' tab, selecting ``Evaluate trialX'' in ``Inner-loop Solver Mode'', then running \ac{EMTG}. If your output looks like that shown in Figure \ref{fig:evaluate_trialx_output} with the text ``Decision vector is feasible'', the initial guess is feasible. (Do not expect the exact numbers to be the same because \ac{EMTG} is a stochastic optimizer.) Let’s increase the fidelity of this mission further.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Flybys_evaluate_trialx_output.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:evaluate_trialx_output}Evaluate TrialX Output.}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conversion to High-fidelity Mission}
\label{sec:conversion_to_single_phase_journeys}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The high-fidelity conversion script takes an \ac{EMTG} options file with single-Phase Journeys and solution as input. It’s located in \texttt{EMTG/PyEMTG/HighFidelity/HighFidelityDriverFunction.py}. Before running it, you need to check another system path command in the file \texttt{EMTG/PyEMTG/HighFide lity/HighFidelityJourney.py}. As before, open the file in a text editor and check that the \texttt{sys.path.append} line near the top of the file points to your PyEMTG folder, or the Python import statements will not work correctly.

\noindent Now open \texttt{HighFidelityDriverFunction.py} in a text editor. This conversion script does not use command-line arguments. Instead, scroll down to the ``\texttt{if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":}'' section. Change the \texttt{originalOptionsFile} variable to point to the single-Phase Journeys \ac{EMTG} options file. Change the \texttt{originalMissionsFile} variable to point to the single-Phase Journeys \ac{EMTG} solution file, and the \texttt{outputFilePath} variable to point to the directory where you wish to save the high-fidelity \ac{EMTG} options file. This section in your file should now look something like the one in Figure \ref{fig:highfidelitydriverfunction_example}.

\noindent Save and run the script using the terminal command:

\noindent \texttt{python EMTG/PyEMTG/HighFidelity/HighFidelityDriverFunction.py} 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Flybys_highfidelitydriverfunction_example.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:highfidelitydriverfunction_example}HighFidelityDriverFunction.py Example.}
\end{figure}

\noindent A new file called \texttt{HighFidelity.emtgopt} should be created in the directory you specified in \texttt{outputFilePath}. Open it with PyEMTG.

\noindent Notice that you now have several more Journeys. The \ac{EMTG} mission now proceeds from Earth periapse to Earth \acs{SOI} to Venus \acs{SOI} to Venus periapse to Venus \acs{SOI} to Mars. The converter has also included the \acs{SOI} radius from the Earth and Venus Universe files when defining the ephemeris-referenced arrival states. Table \ref{tab:high_fidelity_journey_state_types} shows the new Journey configuration.

\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{small}
		\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth} { >{\arraybackslash} X >{\arraybackslash} X >{\arraybackslash} X >{\arraybackslash} X >{\arraybackslash} X}
			\hline
			Journey Name & Journey\newline Departure Type & Journey\newline Departure Class & Journey\newline Arrival Type & Journey\newline Arrival Class \\
			\hline 
			EarthLaunch & 0: launch or\newline direct insertion & 3: Periapse & 2: Intercept with bounded V\_infinity & 2: Ephemeris-referenced \\
			 & & & & \\
			Earth\_to\_Mars\_\newline phase0 & 2: free direct departure & 1: Free point & 2: Intercept with bounded V\_infinity & 0: Ephemeris-referenced \\ 
			 & & & & \\
			VenusGAi & 2: free direct departure & 1: Free point & 2: Intercept with bounded V\_infinity & 3: Periapse \\
			 & & & & \\
			Venus GAo & 2: free direct departure & 1: Free point & 2: Intercept with bounded V\_infinity & 2: Ephemeris-referenced \\
			 & & & & \\
			Earth\_to\_Mars\_\newline phase1 & 3: free direct departure & 0: Free point & 2: Insertion into parking orbit\newline (use chemical Isp) & 0: Ephemeris-pegged \\ 
 			\hline
		\end{tabularx}
	\end{small}
	\caption{\label{tab:high_fidelity_journey_state_types}High Fidelity Journey State Types.}
\end{table}

\noindent Note that neither of the conversion scripts changed the Mars ephemeris-pegged arrival to the more realistic Mars \acs{SOI} to Mars free point arrival orbit you created in the Journey Boundaries tutorial. You’ll need to do that yourself. Since it was covered previously, you won’t update the high-fidelity mission here. The high-fidelity conversion script only converts ephemeris-pegged launches and ephemeris-pegged flybys to propagated trajectories.

\noindent Like with the single-Phase conversion script, the high-fidelity flyby conversion script also generates initial guesses for the new decision variables, and you can examine them in the new \texttt{HighFidelity.e mtgopt} file. Unlike the results of the single-Phase conversion, though, you should not necessarily expect the high-fidelity decision variables to produce a feasible solution without optimization, even if the starting low-fidelity \ac{EMTG} case was feasible. However, the initial guess is usually quite good, though the quality of the initial guess tends to degrade as the flyby speed decreases (i.e., for near-parabolic flybys).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Flyby Sensitivity}
\label{sec:flyby_sensitivity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Select the ``VenusGAi'' (Venus gravity assist in) journey. An example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:high_fidelity_journey_options}. Notice at the bottom of the Journey options, there is a section of options related to the match point and integration step size. Between each Journey departure and arrival, \ac{EMTG} places a ``match point'' (sometimes also known as a ``break point'') where the state integrated forwards from current Journey departure state and the state integrated backwards from the current Journey arrival state need to match, see Figure \ref{fig:non_zsoi_transcription}. Matching states near a gravity assist periapse is tricky because of the sensitive dynamics, and it can be difficult for \acs{SNOPT} to converge if the match point is not ideally placed.

\noindent To deal with this, the conversion script overrode the default match point location (halfway in time between Journey arrival and departure) and placed the match point close to periapse. This results in a value for ``Where do you want to place the match point? (fraction)'' of 0.9 (90\% of the way from the SOI to periapse or equivalently 10\% of the way from periapse to the \acs{SOI}). The conversion script has also reduced the integration step size backwards from periapse to 60 seconds rather than 600 seconds at the \acs{SOI} forwards because the spacecraft is moving much faster near periapse than near the \acs{SOI} boundary. Switch to the ``VenusGAo'' (Venus gravity assist out) Journey and notice that these values are reversed. The values pre-populated in these fields by the conversion script are rules of thumb and should be overridden by the user as appropriate for each unique scenario. These changes can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:gravity_assist_options}.

	\caption{\label{fig:high_fidelity_journey_options}High Fidelity Journey Options Tab.}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Periapse State Representation}
\label{sec:periapse_state_representation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Switch to the ``Physics Options'' tab. At the bottom of the PyEMTG window are additional options to specify how \ac{EMTG} defines states in the multiple shooting problem. The ``PeriapseBoundary state representation'' option specifies the flyby periapse state definition. The default is ``SphericalRADEC'' for spherical right-ascension and declination. Click the drop-down list to see the other state representations available to define the periapse state. Sometimes switching the periapse state encoding can make it easier for \acs{SNOPT} to converge on a solution.

\noindent It is possible to switch this state representation and define additional flyby constraints such as B-plane targets using this feature as shown in Figure \ref{fig:state_representation_settings}. This is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Flybys_state_representation_settings.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:state_representation_settings}Example of Different State Representation Settings.}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Run the Mission}
\label{sec:run_the_mission_high_fidelity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Run the high-fidelity mission (Ctrl + r) with \acs{MBH} using the initial guess created by the high-fidelity conversion script encoded automatically in the generated \ac{EMTG} options file. You should not expect the initial guess to be feasible. However, the guess should help \ac{EMTG} find a solution much faster than running this high-fidelity script without a guess due to the larger decision vector, larger constraint vector, and increased sensitivity of the problem. In practice, \ac{EMTG} can often converge to a feasible high-fidelity trajectory based on this process with a single \acs{NLP} solve (i.e., no \acs{MBH}). Try it yourself and see! 

\noindent This concludes the tutorial on high-fidelity flybys. You can now convert a low-fidelity but easy-to-solve \ac{EMTG} options file using a ``Flyby sequence'' to a sequence of Journeys which more accurately model the spacecraft’s trajectory. In the Force Models tutorial, you will learn how to increase the realism further by adding additional gravitational bodies and other perturbing forces.
