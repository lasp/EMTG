\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

This document presents a conceptual overview of the \acl{EMTG} (\acs{EMTG}) design. Each functional unit of the program is described in text. This document is \textit{not} intended to be a mathematics specification.

This document is intended to be used side-by-side with the \ac{EMTG} Doxygen-generated documentation. The Software Design Document describes the functional units of the design, and the Doxygen output maps the design to the code.
