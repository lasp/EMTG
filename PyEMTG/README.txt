Welcome to PyEMTG, a python GUI for EMTG. 
To use this program you will need to:

   1. Install a Python interpreter with the wxPython, Astropy, Scipy, Numpy, and Matplotlib packages. We recommend Python(x,y).
   
   2. Edit the file "PyEMTG.options" to point PyEMTG to wherever EMTG lives on your hard drive
   
   3. Double-click on "PyEMTG.py" to run it in your interpreter or alternatively type "run PyEMTG.py" in your interpreter's interactive window.


PyEMTG may be used to:

   1. Edit and run EMTG options files (.emtgopt)
   
   2. Plot trajectories and other post-processing data of interest (.emtg)

Note: the is strange behavior when using PyEMTG with WxPython version 3.0.0 or newer. I recommend sticking to 2.9.5
