PyEMTG is a set of Python scripts that provide capabilities such as a \ac{GUI} for \ac{EMTG} and automated trade study utilities (i.e., \ac{PEATSA}). Full PyEMTG documentation is contained in the \ac{EMTG} repository's /PyEMTG/docs/ directory. In that directory, see PyEMTG\_docs\_readme.pdf for an overview of available PyEMTG documentation, which includes a reference to the PyEMTG User's Guide.
