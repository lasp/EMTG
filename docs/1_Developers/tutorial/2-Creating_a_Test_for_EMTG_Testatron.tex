\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Welcome to the second \ac{EMTG} Testatron tutorial. The goal of this tutorial is to familiarize users with the process of creating a new test to use with the Testatron system. Before starting this tutorial, you should have completed the first tutorial on how to run Testatron. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Reason for Creating a Test}
\label{sec:reason_for_creating_a_test}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before creating a test, it is first important to consider whether creating a new test is necessary. At present, there should be tests for all \ac{EMTG} features, so there should not be a need to create tests for existing features. However, if you are adding a new feature to \ac{EMTG}, or discover that a test was not sufficient for an existing feature, you should create a test that makes sure that feature is working. Essentially, there should be an example case for each new feature that makes sure the feature is working properly. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Test Creation Process}
\label{sec:test_creation_process}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you need to create a test for a new feature, this section will explain the process of creating a test, and how to add the test to Testatron.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Generating Files}
\label{sec:generating_files}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The *.emtgopt and *.emtg files are the two required files to create a test for Testatron. This tutorial will use the OSIRIS-REx mission from the \ac{EMTG} Tutorials as an example to demonstrate the creation of a new test.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Make a copy of the OSIRIS-REx.emtgopt file from the EMTG tutorials and move it to a new directory called OSIRIS-REx\_testatron. 
	\item Open the file in PyEMTG and rename the mission to OSIRIS-Rex\_testatron. 
	\item Navigate to the Solver Options page and change the following options as shown in Figure \ref{fig:solver_options}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item\textbf{Inner-Loop Solver Mode:}`` \acs{NLP} with initial guess''
		\begin{itemize}		
			\item The test version of the OSIRIS-REx mission will not use \ac{MBH} because it is a stochastic optimizer. Instead, it will use the \ac{NLP} solver \acs{SNOPT}, which is deterministic, to propagate the solution. Using these settings ensures the test results are reproduceable. 
		\end{itemize}
		\item\textbf{Quiet NLP Solver:} ``Off''
		\item\textbf{Trial decision vector or initial guess:} path to a previous run of the OSIRIS-REx mission
	\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Testatron_OSIRIS-REx_solver_options.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:solver_options}OSIRIS-REx\_testatron Solver Options.}
\end{figure}

	\item Update the path to the working directory so that output will go into the new folder. Then, run the Mission using PyEMTG (File-\textgreater Run or Ctrl+r).

Now that *.emtgopt and *.emtg files have been generated, they need to be placed into the correct Testatron test folder. Imagine that the OSIRIS-REx\_testatron.emtgopt file was using a new feature in the Solver Options tab. In this case, the new test would go in the ``solver\_options'' folder in the Testatron tests directory. 

	\item Copy the *.emtgopt and *.emtg files files into \textless EMTG\_root\_dir\textgreater\textbackslash testatron\textbackslash tests\textbackslash solver\_opti-\newline\indent ons.

NOTE: You should not copy tests into the ``tests\_that\_dont\_work'' folder as this folder is for tests that are expected to fail with the current build of \ac{EMTG}.

	\item Copy the OSIRIS-REx mission default.emtg\_spacecraftopt and default.emtg\_propulsionsystem-\indent opt files from the OSIRIS-REx hardware\_models folder into the \textless EMTG\_root\_dir\textgreater\textbackslash testatron\textbackslash{} HardwareModels folder. All other required files in the hardware\_models folder and the Universe folder are already in the corresponding Testatron folders.

NOTE: There is no need to change the paths to ``hardware\_models'' or the Universe folder in the *.emtgopt file, because Testatron will do this automatically.\knownissuelabel{However, if you use a *.emtg\_spacecraftopt or *.emtg\_propulsionsystemopt file that contains a path to another file, such as a *.ThrottleTable file, this path will need to be updated manually within the spacecraft or propulsion system options file.}{hardware_options_file_paths_issue}

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Running the New Test}
\label{sec:running_the_new_test}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now that all the required files are added, the new test can be run using the run test case command:

\texttt{python testatron.py --emtg <EMTG\_root\_dir>\textbackslash bin\textbackslash EMTGv9.exe --pyemtg <EMTG\_root\_\newline\indent dir>\textbackslash PyEMTG\textbackslash{} -c <EMTG\_root\_dir>\textbackslash testatron\textbackslash tests\textbackslash solver\_options\textbackslash OSIRIS-REx\_test\newline\indent atron}

\noindent The test should run quickly, but you will notice that it fails on the initial run as shown in Figure \ref{fig:osiris_testatron_initial_run}.

\noindent\knownissuelabel{NOTE: This failure is due to Testatron slightly changes some of the numbers used in the OSIRIS-REx\_testatron.emtgopt file, which causes \ac{EMTG} to produce slightly different results. This is likely occurring from number to string conversions in python. A bug ticket has been created for this.}{testatron_changes_emtgopt_issue}

	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Testatron_OSIRIS-REx_initial_run.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:osiris_testatron_initial_run}Initial run output.}
\end{figure}

\noindent To address the slight numerical differences, navigate to the output folder for the test run (located in \textless EMTG\_root\_dir\textgreater\textbackslash testatron\textbackslash output\textbackslash{} \textless time-of-test\textgreater) and copying the OSIRIS-REx\_testatron.emtg file into the solver\_options folder. Run the test again using the same command and it should pass. Example output is shown in Figure \ref{fig:osiris_testatron_success}.

	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Testatron_OSIRIS-REx_fixed_run.png}}
	\caption{\label{fig:osiris_testatron_success}Fixed run output.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Congratulations, you have successfully added a test to Testatron and completed the Testatron Tutorials!
