Evolutionary Mission Trajectory Generator (EMTG) Open Source Release
Originating author: Jacob Englander
Maintainer: NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center (GSFC) Code 595 EMTG team (GSFC-DL-TrajOpt-Support@mail.nasa.gov)
CU LASP Maintainer: Jeremy Knittel (jeremy.knittel@lasp.colorado.edu)

=============================================================================================================================
~~~~~~~~
Purpose:
~~~~~~~~
The contents of this NASA GSFC public software release distribution contains all of the source code and documentation for the 
Evolutionary Mission Trajectory Generator (EMTG). Select third-party code is included in this release as indicated in the 
subsequent 'Dependencies section'. Users will need to download and install all other third-party dependencies mentioned in 
the build guide. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
EMTG has several software dependencies but all are free software. EMTG requires an optimization package, and currently either
the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer (SNOPT, not free) and the Interior Point OPTimizer (IPOPT, free) are tested and verified.

If using SNOPT, the current EMTG software is configured to work best with SNOPT 7.6. To acquire SNOPT visit their product page 
(http://sbsi-sol-optimize.com/asp/sol_product_snopt.htm). 

The following dependencies have been bundled with this release and files associated with them can be found in /depend/:
-– Boost 1.79.0
-– CSPICE 64bit
-– GSL 2.4.0
-- MinGW 7.2.0 [Windows only](variant: 64-bit, posix (threading), and seh (exception handler))
-– randutils rev 2

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The GSFC EMTG team is primarily using Windows and Linux. Both Windows and Linux build guides are included.

The CU LASP team is primarily using Mac and Linux. The CMake build system has NOT been updated for the CU LASP fork, and small 
modifications are likely necessary. To use IPOPT only, ensure compiler flag 'NOSNOPT' is set. To use SNOPT only, ensure 
compiler flag 'NOIPOPT' is set. Reach out to the GSFC EMTG team for help modifying CMake build system. 

Navigate to the /docs/build_system/ directory for EMTG_*_build_system*.pdf documents detailing step-by-step instructions on 
how to install the software dependencies and build EMTG. These documents are catered to specific software dependency 
versions. Alternative versions may work but proceed at your own risk when deviating from the provided install guidance.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: Is there a user guide?
A: Yes. There are a couple of User Guides is in the /docs/0_Users/ directory. 

Q: Is there a reason the GUI is limited in functionality?
A: Due to limited staffing, core functionality was prioritized. This is an excellent opportunity for contribution from the 
open source community.

Q: Can you give me technical support for installing and operating EMTG?
A: Feel free to reach out to the team contact information provided at the header of this file but be aware that the 
development team has limited availability to respond to all inquiries. There is also a discussion functionality on the 
EMTG GitHub page where you can post and engage with the community for support.

Q: Will EMTG work on Linux?
A: Yes, it will. Linux build instructions are provided with this release.

Q: Will EMTG work on a Mac? If so, why is there not a Mac build document?
A: Yes EMTG should work on a Mac. The development team did not have access to a Mac to be able to do development/testing and the
CU LASP development team did not have the ability to test a reliable build system for it. 

Q: Will EMTG work on my smart phone?
A: We are not pursuing getting EMTG to run on a smart phone, but if you try it and it works, we'd love to hear about it!

Q: How frequently will you update EMTG?
A: Resources are limited for the development team so open source releases will occure infrequently.

Q: Can you make me an executable?
A: No. EMTG depends on a number of third-party packages and NASA/University of Colorado does not have the rights to distribute all of them.

Q: Why doesn't my PyEMTG work?
A: The various Python packages and libraries change fast and the development team has limited resources. The build system 
instructions are focused on specific Python package versions but may also work with other versions. Please make 
adjustments to PyEMTG as-needed to make it work on your system.

Q: I have a different SNOPT version than what is listed in the build system instructions. Will it work with EMTG?
A: It is possible other versions will work. Feel free to try it and if you succeed consider providing us with updates we 
can incorporate in future releases. You can make changes to /src/InnerLoop/snoptProblemExtension.h to get it to talk to 
your SNOPT.

Q: Can I use this commercially?
A: Yes.

Q: Can I teach a class with this?
A: Absolutely!

Q: I found a bug! How can I submit the bug so it can potentially be fixed in a future version?
A: Thank you for finding the bug and wanting to improve future versions. Please either email us about the bug or post to 
the Issues section of GitHub so that we can fix it for future versions!
