\subsubsection{Purpose}
\noindent \ac{EMTG} depends on the commercial \ac{NLP} solver package \ac{SNOPT} to perform gradient-based optimization. \ac{EMTG} has interfaces known to work for \ac{SNOPT} versions 7.5, 7.6, and 7.7. These instructions assume that the user uses MinGW and specifically the gfortran module it is bundled with to compile \ac{SNOPT}.

\subsubsection{Download Location}
\noindent The main page for the software distributions is in the following website: \\
For more information on obtaining \ac{SNOPT}, see \url{http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/asp/sol_product_snopt.htm}.

\noindent The \ac{SNOPT} source code that is obtained from \ac{SBSI} can be extracted to a folder on your local system. The root directory of this folder will be called \textbf{\textless SNOPT\_root\_dir\textgreater} for future references.
