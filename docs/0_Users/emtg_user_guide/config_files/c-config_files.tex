\chapter{Configuration Files}
\label{chap:config_files}
This chapter describes how configuration files may be used to model performance characteristics of the spacecraft and launch vehicles used when obtaining solutions.
While vehicle characteristics may be set in the PyEMTG \ac{GUI}, configuration files are the most flexible option for defining vehicle characteristics.
Additionally, these files may be shared across missions, allowing users to define configuration files for specific vehicles that may be consistently re-used, such as a particular launch vehicle.
These files are used exclusively for options {\it 0: Assemble from libraries} and {\it 1: Read .emtg\_spacecraftoptions file} in the Spacecraft Option tab's ``Spacecraft model type'' field in PyEMTG, or by respectively setting the {\tt SpacecraftModelInput} value in the {\tt .emtgopt} file.
